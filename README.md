# Jot Bot
 A small, private discord bot originally created for the purpose of learning more advanced Python techniques, as well as basic backend programming with SQL/SQLite. It is now also a fully functional music bot.
 
 It will not be invited to any servers without explicit permission, but feel free to copy whatever code from it you'd like for your own bots!
 
 # Features
