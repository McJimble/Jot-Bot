# Jot Bot
 A small, private discord bot originally created for the purpose of learning more advanced Python techniques, as well as basic backend programming with SQL/SQLite. It is now also a fully functional music bot.
 It will not be invited to any servers without explicit permission, but feel free to copy whatever code from it you'd like for your own bots!
 
 # Features
 - A "Casino" system where the user can spend their 'balance' on games such as blackjack and slot machines. Comes with a leaderboard and rankings for your server
 - Fully functional Youtube/music player that can play audio in a voice channel. Comes with helpful utilities such as skipping, vote skipping, a queue, and volume control
