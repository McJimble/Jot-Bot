# Jot Bot, a Discord Music Bot + More!
 A small, private discord bot I had originally created for the purpose of learning more advanced Python techniques, as well as basic backend programming with SQL/SQLite. It is now also a fully functional music bot.
 
 I basically just add whatever features seem cool or useful in the moment for myself or my friends.
 
 It will not be invited to any servers without explicit permission, but feel free to copy whatever code from it you'd like for your own bots!
 I'd let people add it but Discord's TOS forbids verified bots from playing audio from Youtube, and it's required to be verified after it's in 100 servers.
 
 # Features
 - A "Casino" system where the user can spend their 'balance' on games such as blackjack and slot machines. Comes with a leaderboard and rankings for your server
